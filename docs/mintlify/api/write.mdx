## ACID Guarantees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Atomicity">
    All records are written or none are. No partial writes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consistency">
    Schema validation ensures data integrity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Isolation">
    Concurrent writes don't interfere with each other.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Durability">
    Once committed, data is permanently stored in S3.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Auto-Compaction

After many writes, you may see:
```json
{
  "compaction_recommended": true,
  "small_files_count": 15
}
```

<Tip>
Run COMPACT operation to merge small files and improve query performance.
</Tip>

## Batch Size

Recommended batch size: **100-1000 records**

For larger datasets:
```python
# Batch writes
batch_size = 1000
for i in range(0, len(records), batch_size):
    batch = records[i:i + batch_size]
    write_request(batch)
```
